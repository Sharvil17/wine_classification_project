# Wine Classification Project

## Project Summary
This project involves classifying wine types using machine learning techniques. The dataset used is the Wine dataset from scikit-learn.

## Dataset
The Wine dataset contains 13 features of 178 wine samples, classified into 3 classes.

## Machine Learning Model
A RandomForestClassifier is used to classify the wine samples. The model is trained on 80% of the data and tested on 20%.

## Insights
- The model achieved high accuracy in classifying the wine types.
- The confusion matrix and classification report provide detailed insights into model performance across different classes.
